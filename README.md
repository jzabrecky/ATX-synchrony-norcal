# ATX-synchrony-norcal

This project contains the code for a WIP evaluating the synchrony between whole river gross primary productivity, benthic cyanobacterial accrual, and anatoxin production in rivers of northern California. The code follows the order:

1.  Modeling metabolism using *StreamMetabolizer*
2.  Processing field and lab data (benthic survey data, water chemistry data, anatoxin concentrations, and metabolism estimates)
3.  Predicting taxon-specific benthic cyanobacteria cover and anatoxin concentrations

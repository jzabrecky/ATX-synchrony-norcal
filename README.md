# ATX-synchrony-norcal

This project contains the code for a WIP documenting patterns in taxon-specific benthic cyanobacterial dynamics (cover and anatoxin concentrations) and gross primary productivity (GPP) in rivers of northern Califonia and using GPP in addition to abiotic covariates to make preditions.

1.  Modeling metabolism using *StreamMetabolizer*
2.  Processing field and lab data (benthic survey data, water chemistry data, anatoxin concentrations, and metabolism estimates)
3.  Predicting taxon-specific benthic cyanobacteria cover and anatoxin concentrations

to find out why this is a problem and how to eliminate them."
"2","There were 4 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low. See

"3","Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems"
"4","The largest R-hat is 1.16, indicating chains have not mixed.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See

"5","Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See

"6","Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
